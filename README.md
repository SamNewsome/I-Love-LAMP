# I-Love-LAMP
Brick killed a guy.

“I’m Brick Tamland. People seem to like me because I am polite and I am rarely late. I like to eat ice cream and I really enjoy a nice pair of slacks. Years later, a doctor will tell me that I have an I.Q. of 48 and am what some people call mentally retarded.”

“Brick was a great man and I will miss him so much and I will not rest until I find his killer. It’s hard for me to believe that he is gone. [cries] I feel like I just saw him yesterday. When I got the news I didn’t even know how to make sense out of it. Why?! Why?! Why did you take him from us?! BRICK IS DEAD!”
